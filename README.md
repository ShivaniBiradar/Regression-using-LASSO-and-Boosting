# Regression-using-LASSO-and-Boosting

# Main Tasks:

- Pre-process data and impute the missing values using "mean substitution" method
- Plot a correlation matrix for the features in the dataset
- Select 11 features with highest Coefficient of Variation and plotting scatter plots and box plots for them
- Perform Linear Regression using least squares, LASSO Regression (with alpha chosen using Cross Validation) and Ridge Regression (with alpha chosen using Cross Validation) and compare the results
- Fit a Principal Component Regression model with M (number of principal components) chosen by Cross Validation and comparing the results
- Fit L1-penalized gradient boosting tree using XGBoost (with alpha chosen using Cross Validation) and compare the performance
